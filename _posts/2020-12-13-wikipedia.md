Earlier this week, one of my fav journals, [The Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy (JITP)](https://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/using-wikipedia-in-the-composition-classroom-and-beyond-encyclopedic-neutrality-social-inequality-and-failure-as-subversion/) :heartbeat:	, published a short article I wrote about using Wikipedia in composition classrooms. Here, I explain that we must show our students how Wikipedia's language policies keep the encyclopedia's infamous racial and gender inequalities in place, especially the policy about writing "neutrally." I outline this in more detail in the JITP article and in this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/cherriekwok/status/1338254217195216902) so if you're interested in this sort of thing, then check it out and let me know what you think.

In the meantime, I'd like to follow up on a few things that I had to leave as footnotes in the article, primarily because I haven't thought them through yet. Maybe someone else can take these up in more detail one day. 

The issue I want to talk about is the encyclopedia's [Conflict of Interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest) policy. This policy stipulates that it would be a conflict of interest for an editor to write Wikipedia entries that are related to themselves, their families, clients, employers, or financial and other external relationships. The rationale here is that to do so would disrupt the entry's reliability, and undermine public confidence in Wikipedia articles as a whole. There are a few protocols in place where editors can self-disclose their conflicts of interest; the best practice is to generally propose changes through the Talk page, but leave the editing and reviewing of the article to others. 

I think this sounds pretty reasonable -- but it struck me when writing the article that such a policy can, in some cases, prevent those with the most knowledge about a subject to contribute to a Wikipedia entry. A case in point is, again, UVA. Although the university contains experts and projects that have investigated how enslaved labor, eugenics, and white supremacy are intertwined with UVa's history, this conflict of interest policy prevents them from contributing or reviewing Wikipedia entries about these subjects as they relate to UVA. It also prevents them from fulfilling the *institutional responsibility* to acknowledge and circulate these facts about the university.  Of course, one could argue that we can bring in a non-UVA affiliated editor or expert to review and edit those Wikipedia entries -- but the point is that, ethically, it seems like those at UVA should perform that labor. It's possible that the same double-bind I've described here might be occurring for other institutions and groups. If so, then Wikipedia might need to reconsider their conflict of interest policy to accommodate situations like these... :eyes:
