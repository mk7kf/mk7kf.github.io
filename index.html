    <p>I was born in Hong Kong, and raised in both Hong Kong and in Vancouver, Canada. I am completing my PhD in literature at the University of Virginia, where I am an Elizabeth Arendall Tilney and Schuyler Merritt Tilney Predoctoral Fellow at the Jefferson Scholars Foundation.</p>

    <p>I specialize in global Anglophone literatures--including the British literatures--from the long nineteenth century to today, with a focus on race, imperialism, and an artistic style and political concept called Decadence. Some of my early work on these topics received the 2021 British Association for Decadence Studies Postgraduate Essay prize and appears in <i>Volupté: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Decadence Studies</i>. My other writing appears in, or is forthcoming in, <i>One More Voice: BIPOC Voices in the Victorian Periodical Press, Victorian Review, The Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy,</i> and <i>The Literary Encyclopedia</i>. My dissertation, which I will defend in April 2024, is titled "After Haiti: Race, Empire, and Global Decadent Literary Resistance, 1804-1984."</p> 

    <p>Alongside my work at UVa, I work as an Associate Editor for <a href="https://undiscipliningvc.org"><i> Undisciplining the Victorian Classroom</i> (UVC)</a>, and hold a Visiting Research Fellowship at <a href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/decadence-research-centre/"> the Decadence Research Centre</a> at Goldsmiths, University of London. I also have secondary interests in critical theory, queer theory, world literature, postcolonialism, and the digital humanities.</p>
      
    <p>I'm always happy to meet those inside and outside of academia. Please feel free to get in touch. </p>
