  <p>I was born and raised in Hong Kong, and I also have roots in Vancouver Island, Canada. I specialize in Global Anglophone literatures (including the British Romantic and Victorian literatures) from the long nineteenth century to today, with a focus on race, imperialism, and an artistic style and political concept called decadence. I also have interests in critical theory, queer theory, world literature and translation, postcolonialism, and the digital humanities. I am presently crafting my first book project based on my doctoral dissertation, "After Haiti: Race, Empire, and Global Decadent Literary Resistance, 1804-1984." I also serve as an Associate Editor for <a href="https://undiscipliningvc.org"><i> Undisciplining the Victorian Classroom</i> (UVC)</a>, and hold a Visiting Research Fellowship at <a href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/decadence-research-centre/"> the Decadence Research Centre</a> at Goldsmiths, University of London, where I am the Founder of the newly conceived Global Decadence Lab.</p>

  <p>In Fall 2024, I will be a Research Associate and Lecturer at the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Virginia—an institution that decided, on Saturday May 4, 2024, to set the armed riot police on hundreds of undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, staff, and Charlottesville community members due to an unobstructive and peaceful protest about Palestinian liberation. At the time that the police descended onto the protest encampment, there were about twenty students, twelve tents, a set of umbrellas, and cardboard signs on a patch of grass next to the university's chapel and the Memorial to Enslaved Laborers.</p>

  <p>The five-hour ordeal saw the riot police pepper spraying and beating hundreds in the crowd with mace guns and shields whether they were involved with the protest or not, and dragging people by their arms and legs across the grass in order to arrest them. Meanwhile, the university’s leadership did not return the many desperate calls, emails, and texts from faculty who were attempting to de-escalate the situation. Instead, they sat in a room where—as they themselves admitted in a virtual town hall to a public audience of 3000 three days later—they watched their own students, colleagues, and townspeople suffer in real-time through a live video feed.</p>

  <p>Thousands of alumni, students, and faculty have since rejected this utterly unacceptable course of action. Below are just four of 60 letters and counting that the student organizations, departments, and faculty members have publicly issued and I stand by all of them. You can find the full thread of letters <a href="https://x.com/socialistdogmom/status/1787282510935658894">here.</a></p> 

<p>Letter #1: <a href="https://x.com/ALYOUSEF94/status/1787262806921802009">Resignation from the Religion, Diversity, and Belonging Task Force by a faculty member in the Department of Religion</a></p>
<p>Letter #2: <a href="https://woodson.as.virginia.edu/cgwi-directors-statement-may-4th-2024">The Carter G. Woodson Institute of African-American and African Studies</a></p>
<p>Letter #3: <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GM2z9ZRWAAEunu8?format=jpg&name=large">Muslims United, Pakistani Students' Association, Afghan Students Association, Black Muslims at UVA, Environmental Justice Collective, Black Student Alliance, Bengali Student Organization, the Asian Student Union, and the Sikh Students Association</a></p>
