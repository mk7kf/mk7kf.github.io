      <h2>What I do . . .</h2>
      <p>I am a doctoral candidate at the University of Virginia and an Associate Editor at <a href="https://undiscipliningvc.org/"><i>Undisciplining the Victorian Classroom.</i></a></p>
      <p>Broadly speaking, I focus on <b>global Anglophone literature from the long nineteenth and early twentieth-centuries, with interests in an artistic style called Decadence and its relationship to Empire and postcolonial theory.</b> My dissertation, which has been supported by the Jefferson Scholars Foundation since 2020, examines how African-American, Caribbean, East-Asian, South-Asian, and Indigenous writers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries produced new versions of Decadence in order to articulate anti-imperial perspectives in their literature. In the process, I expose how Decadence—commonly thought of as an imperialist aesthetic—can support anti-imperial politics. Some of my early work on these topics recently received the 2021 British Association for Decadence Studies Postgraduate Essay prize. </p>
        <p>I also have interests in the digital humanities, where my work has been supported by the UVa School of Data Science and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.</p>

      <p>In 2022, I received the Distinguished Graduate Teaching Award in the Arts and Humanities for my teaching and the Predoctoral-Postdoctoral Jefferson Fellowship for my research. From 2020-2022, I held the Elizabeth Arendall Tilney and Schuyler Merritt Tilney Jefferson Fellowship. I completed my MA at New York University, where I received the Millicent Bell Prize for the most outstanding Master's thesis in the English Department. </p>
    
    <p>I am co-chairing a university-wide symposium about anti-racist teaching at UVa this November 2022. I will also chair a conference about Decadence in March 2023, titled <a href="http://decadence-2023.com"> "Global Decadence, Race, and the Futures of Decadence Studies."</a> Please reach out if you are interested in participating in either of these events.</p>

              var typeText = document.querySelector(".typeText")
              var textToBeTypedArr = ["My first brush with Decadence occurred when I came across Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray while I was growing up in Hong Kong. At that time, I didn’t know that his views on art, or his writing style, were a part of something called the Decadent Movement. I only knew that I was curious about the elegant twists and turns in his sentences, and his witty yet troubled characters. It wasn’t until I began exploring literature more thoroughly that I saw how his work—and the European Decadent Movement more broadly—was deeply intertwined with exoticism, and bore traces of the imperial age that the movement and its writers lived in.", "It is interesting that this discovery about the relationship between European Decadence and Empire emerged while I was pursuing doctorate, because it was also at this point that I began to see how literary studies as a whole also bears traces of imperial ideology. It must not be forgotten that, as critics like Gauri Viswanathan have shown, English literature was institutionalized in the nineteenth century in part to “civilize” the colonies, and that Euro-American higher education more broadly is still addressing its relationship to colonialism, enslavement, and white supremacy. I am reminded of this at the University of Virginia, which sits on stolen Monacan Land, and was also built by enslaved laborers. I am also reminded of this when I realize that most of my English courses did not contain any of the writers I am now examining in my dissertation.", "As a recipient of two fellowships that bear the name of the university’s founder—a man who, were he alive today, would have likely disapproved of who I am and what my work represents—I am often asked how I feel about these contradictions. Here, a line from Fred Moten and Stefano Harney’s The Undercommons comes to mind. “It cannot be denied that the university is a place of refuge,” they wrote, “and it cannot be accepted that the university is a place of enlightenment.”", "On one hand, it would be misguided to revere universities as the only—or the best—places where intellectual development occurs, or disregard the past (and present) oppressions that such institutions have played a role in maintaining. On the other hand, to reject all of academia outright overlooks how much going to school means to a lot of people, especially those outside of the United States. Education was, and remains, one of the most important things to my family, in part because an education—that is, the dedicated time and space to develop one’s intellectual interests in communion with others—was denied to those who came before me.", "I was reminded of this when my maternal grandmother passed away in Hong Kong, just when I started to teach for the first time in Charlottesville. I sat down after receiving the news and thought about her life from beginning to end. One long thread. Since she could not afford to attend school, she spoke Cantonese but she was illiterate in the dialect, as well as in Mandarin and English. She also did not know her own date of birth. But, in the late 1990s, she made a plucky and audacious decision that ensured my mother—and, in turn, my younger sister and I—would speak and live in the languages and literatures that she never had the chance to learn.", "The rise of a particularly strict iteration of communism in mainland China had prompted many like my grandmother to face a difficult choice at the end of the twentieth century: to stay or to flee? They had heard about an island across the water from mainland China called Hong Kong, which was at that time still a British colony. So, still an oppressive regime—but it was rumored that life over there was somewhat freer than life over here. Since Chinese officials wanted to discourage their citizens from leaving, however, one of the only ways to get to Hong Kong was to swim there. It was a journey that took at least four to eight hours. Many had died in the attempt, killed either by Chinese gunboats or sharks, or drowning due to the demanding exertions that were required to swim across the strait.","When my grandmother leapt into the ocean, she did not know what awaited her. Was it freedom? Was it death? Sometimes both can look the same, and we do not know which it is until we get to the other side. And sometimes even then we still do not know.", "What I do know, though, is that as my grandmother swam, she slipped out of the grasp of two oppressive land masses, and existed briefly in that fluid space between what is and what could be. It would not last, of course. But that risky oceanic interlude made all the difference for those who came after her.", "My grandmother became one of the estimated 12,000 fugitives that news outlets like the New York Times and the South China Morning Post later dubbed as Hong Kong's “freedom swimmers.” I do the kind of work I do in part because, like my grandmother, I want to dive into that space between what is and what could be, to swim toward something more than what I have seen today. It is no secret that the ivory tower continues to replicate many of the new (and some of the old) oppressions that my grandmother would face once she reached Hong Kong's shores as a refugee, soaked to the skin: Eurocentrism, racism, sexism, elitism. Much of what I do is committed to pulling our understanding of literature and history, and our profession as a whole, away from the oppressive pressures that shaped my grandmother’s time and continue to shape ours, and toward something wider and somewhat freer. These thoughts inform what research projects I take on, how I teach, and where I commit my time and attention in my life within, and outside of, academia.", "My absence from my grandmother’s funeral because of travel restrictions during the pandemic is one of the most painful regrets of my life. But like any good teacher I suppose she has already taught me everything that I need to know. Scientists have discovered that trauma is passed down from generation to generation -- but so is hope, joy, and that restless fervor for more, more, more. She has been showing the way forward for me, ever since I was child. Always forward. Always placing faith into the unknown. And always with a smile."]
