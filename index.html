	<h2>Dissertation :book:</h2>
	<p>My work examines the relationship between literature and politics. More specifically, I'm studying how writers from Black America, the Caribbean, China, and India articulated anti-imperial ideas in their poetry and prose using a late-Victorian artistic style called Decadence. Starting from the long 19th century and stretching up to the present day, I trace how Decadence has shaped and provoked major political changes in the past and explore how it can help us reimagine a better future.</p>
