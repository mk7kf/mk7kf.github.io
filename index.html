    <p>I was born and raised in Hong Kong and Vancouver, Canada. I am now completing my PhD in literature at the University of Virginia, where I hold the Elizabeth Arendall Tilney and Schuyler Merritt Tilney Fellowship at the Jefferson Scholars Foundation.</p>

    <p>I specialize in global Anglophone literatures in the long 19th and 20th centuries, with a focus on race, imperialism, and an artistic style and political concept called Decadence. Although Decadence is generally associated with white Euro-American writers, my dissertation, <i>After Haiti: Jeanne Duval, Race, and the Rise of Duvalian Decadence,</i> examines how African-American, Caribbean, East Asian, South Asian, and Indigenous writer-politicians in the 19th and 20th centuries produced new versions of Decadence in order to articulate anti-imperial and anti-racist perspectives. Some of my early work on these topics received the 2021 British Association for Decadence Studies Postgraduate Essay prize and appears in <i>Volupté: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Decadence Studies</i>. My other writing appears in, or is forthcoming in, <i>One More Voice: BIPOC Voices in the Victorian Periodical Press, Victorian Review, The Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy, Cha: An Asian Literary Journal,</i> and <i>The Literary Encyclopedia</i>.</p> 

    <p>Alongside my work at UVa, I work as an Associate Editor for <a href="https://undiscipliningvc.org"><i> Undisciplining the Victorian Classroom</i> (UVC)</a>, and hold a Visiting Research Fellowship at <a href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/decadence-research-centre/"> the Decadence Research Centre</a> at Goldsmiths, University of London. I also have secondary interests in critical theory, queer theory, world literature, postcolonialism, and the digital humanities (I coded this website from scratch using HTML and CSS, and you can find the code <a href="https://github.com/mk7kf/mk7kf.github.io">on my Github repo</a>). Before starting my doctorate, I worked full-time for the NYU Center for Data Science, where I translated the Center's research on artificial intelligence and natural language processing into accessible terms for the public.</p>

    <p>In 2022, I received the Distinguished Graduate Teaching Award in the Arts and Humanities for my teaching record, my contributions to <i>UVC</i>, and for establishing an anti-racist pedagogy group in my department. In 2023, I chaired a few conferences based on the themes of my research and about pedagogical approaches.</p>
      
    <p>My experiences growing up in a former British colony and navigating predominantly white educational institutions shape my aim to center the histories of enslavement, race, and imperialism in my research, teaching, and service on the one hand, and, on the other, to construct more thoughtful approaches that can redirect academia toward a more equitable, inspiring, and joyful future. I am invested in mentoring all my students, particularly first-generation students, students of color, and international students. I have also worked as a writing instructor for the UVa Medical School's Summer Medical Leadership Program (an enrichment program for first-generation students from historically underrepresented groups), and at UVa's Writing Center as a tutor with a special focus on student-athletes.</p>
      
    <p>I'm always happy to meet those inside and outside of academia, particularly if they care about the same things that I do. Please feel free to get in touch. </p>
