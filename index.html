    <p>I was born in Hong Kong, and raised in both Hong Kong and in Vancouver, Canada. I am now completing my PhD in literature at the University of Virginia, where I am an Elizabeth Arendall Tilney and Schuyler Merritt Tilney Predoctoral Fellow at the Jefferson Scholars Foundation.</p>

    <p>I specialize in global Anglophone literatures in the long 19th and 20th centuries, with a focus on race, imperialism, and an artistic style and political concept called Decadence. Some of my early work on these topics received the 2021 British Association for Decadence Studies Postgraduate Essay prize and appears in <i>Volupté: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Decadence Studies</i>. My other writing appears in, or is forthcoming in, <i>One More Voice: BIPOC Voices in the Victorian Periodical Press, Victorian Review, The Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy, Cha: An Asian Literary Journal,</i> and <i>The Literary Encyclopedia</i>.</p> 

    <p>Alongside my work at UVa, I work as an Associate Editor for <a href="https://undiscipliningvc.org"><i> Undisciplining the Victorian Classroom</i> (UVC)</a>, and hold a Visiting Research Fellowship at <a href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/decadence-research-centre/"> the Decadence Research Centre</a> at Goldsmiths, University of London. I also have secondary interests in critical theory, queer theory, world literature, postcolonialism, and the digital humanities.

    <p>In 2022, I received the Distinguished Graduate Teaching Award in the Arts and Humanities for my teaching record, my contributions to <i>UVC</i>, and for establishing an anti-racist pedagogy group in my department. In 2023, I chaired a few conferences about the themes of my research and about pedagogical approaches.</p>
      
    <p>My experiences growing up in the former British colony of Hong Kong, and navigating predominantly white educational institutions in the west, shape my aim to center the histories of enslavement, race, and imperialism in all my work on the one hand, and to construct more thoughtful approaches that might redirect academia toward more equitable and joyful futures on the other. I am invested in mentoring all my students, particularly first-generation students, students of color, and international students. I have worked as a writing instructor for the UVa Medical School's Summer Medical Leadership Program (an enrichment program for first-generation students from historically underrepresented groups) and at UVa's Writing Center as a tutor with a special focus on student-athletes.</p>
      
    <p>I'm always happy to meet those inside and outside of academia. Please feel free to get in touch. </p>
