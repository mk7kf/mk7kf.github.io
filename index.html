    <p>I was born and raised in Hong Kong and Vancouver, Canada. I am now completing my PhD in literature at the University of Virginia, where I hold the Elizabeth Arendall Tilney and Schuyler Merritt Tilney Fellowship at the Jefferson Scholars Foundation. Alongside my work at UVa, I work as an Associate Editor for <a href="https://undiscipliningvc.org"><i> Undisciplining the Victorian Classroom</i></a>, and hold a Visiting Research Fellowship at <a href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/decadence-research-centre/"> the Decadence Research Centre</a> at Goldsmiths, University of London.</p>

    <p>Broadly speaking, my research and teaching focus on global Anglophone literatures in the long 19th and 20th centuries. My dissertation project, <i>After Haiti: Jeanne Duval and the Rise of Duvalian Decadence,</i> brings my interests together by examining a late 19th-century artistic style and political concept called Decadence. Although the style and concept are generally associated with white Euro-American writers, my dissertation examines how African-American, Caribbean, East Asian, South Asian, and Indigenous writer-politicians in the 19th and 20th centuries produced new versions of Decadence in order to articulate anti-imperial and anti-racist perspectives. Some of my early work on these topics received the 2021 British Association for Decadence Studies Postgraduate Essay prize.</p>

    <p>I also have secondary interests in critical theory, queer theory, world literature, postcolonialism, and the digital humanities. My digital work in particular has been supported by the UVa School of Data Science and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. I generally focus on issues related to inclusivity in the archival sciences and data management, the aesthetics and politics of Wikipedia and other social media platforms, TEI encoding for preserving and transcribing manuscripts, and web design. (I coded this website from scratch using HTML and CSS, and you can find the code <a href="https://github.com/mk7kf/mk7kf.github.io">on my Github repo.</a>)</p>

    <p>In 2022, I received the Distinguished Graduate Teaching Award in the Arts and Humanities for my teaching. In 2023, I chaired a few conferences about the themes of my research and about pedagogical approaches. My goal across all my research, teaching, and service is to center the histories of enslavement, imperialism, and colonialism on the one hand, and, on the other, imagine more thoughtful approaches and concepts that we can use to redirect the academic profession toward a more equitable, inspiring, and joyful future. I enjoy meeting others who care about these things as well.</p>
