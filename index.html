	<h2>Dissertation</h2>
	<p>I'm examining the relationship between literature and politics. More specifically, I'm studying how writers from Black America, the Caribbean, China, and India constructed anti-imperial ideas in their poetry and prose by drawing on a late-Victorian artistic movement called Decadence. Starting from the long 19th century and stretching to the present day, I ask how Decadence has shaped major political shifts and explore how it can help us reimagine a better future.</p>
