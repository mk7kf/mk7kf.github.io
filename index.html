	<h2>Dissertation</h2>
	<p>My work examines the relationship between literature:book: and politics :earth_africa:. In partiuclar, I'm studying how a set of writers from Black America, the Caribbean, China, and India articulated <b>anti-imperial ideas</b>:crown: in their poetry and prose. I reveal that these writers did so by using——and reinventing——a late-Victorian artistic and social movement called <b>Decadence</b>:sparkles:. Starting from the long 19th century and stretching up to our contemporary moment, I reveal how Decadence has shaped, supported, and provoked major political changes in the past, and highlight how it can continue to support those in our present who want to reimagine a better future in academia and outside of it.:dancers:</p>
