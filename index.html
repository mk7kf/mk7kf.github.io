    <p>I was born and raised in Hong Kong and Vancouver, Canada. I am now completing my PhD in literature at the University of Virginia, where I hold the Elizabeth Arendall Tilney and Schuyler Merritt Tilney Fellowship at the Jefferson Scholars Foundation. Alongside my work at UVa, I work as an Associate Editor for <a href="https://undiscipliningvc.org"><i> Undisciplining the Victorian Classroom</i> (UVC)</a>, and hold a Visiting Research Fellowship at <a href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/decadence-research-centre/"> the Decadence Research Centre</a> at Goldsmiths, University of London.</p>

    <p>I specialize in global Anglophone literatures in the long 19th and 20th centuries, with a focus on race, imperialism, and an artistic style and political concept called Decadence. Although Decadence is generally associated with white Euro-American writers, my dissertation, <i>After Haiti: Jeanne Duval and the Rise of Duvalian Decadence,</i> examines how African-American, Caribbean, East Asian, South Asian, and Indigenous writer-politicians in the 19th and 20th centuries produced new versions of Decadence in order to articulate anti-imperial and anti-racist perspectives. Some of my early work on these topics received the 2021 British Association for Decadence Studies Postgraduate Essay prize.</p>

    <p>I also have secondary interests in critical theory, queer theory, world literature, postcolonialism, and the digital humanities. (I coded this website from scratch using HTML and CSS, and you can find the code <a href="https://github.com/mk7kf/mk7kf.github.io">on my Github repo.</a>)</p>

    <p>In 2022, I received the Distinguished Graduate Teaching Award in the Arts and Humanities for my teaching record, my contributions to <i>UVC</i>, and for establishing an anti-racist pedagogy group in my department. In 2023, I chaired a few conferences about the themes of my research and about pedagogical approaches. My goal across all my research, teaching, and service is to center the histories of enslavement, race, and imperialism on the one hand, and, on the other, construct more thoughtful approaches and concepts that we can use to redirect academia toward a more equitable, inspiring, and joyful future. I enjoy meeting others who care about these things as well.</p>
