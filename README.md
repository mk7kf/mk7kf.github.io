# mk7kf.github.io
This is my first GitHub website, built with Jekyll.

I'm using this site as a way to share my work with the world. :earth_africa: I'm a digital humanist in training so this project is outside of my comfort zone. But I've always wondered what static websites are like so I thought I'd try it out after many years of using WordPress, SquareSpace, and other platforms. It was more difficult to set up than I expected, so I used <b><a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">this</a></b> helpful resource to get started. Then I looked at <b><a href="http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole">this</a></b> to learn how to modify the standard Minima theme (skipped the Poole steps). :ok_hand: As is the case with most static websites, I've prioritized simplicity and functionality in the web design, with an eye toward ensuring that it reads well on an iPhone as well as on a desktop.
