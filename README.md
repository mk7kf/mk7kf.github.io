# mk7kf.github.io
This is my first GitHub website, built with Jekyll. :computer:  

I'm using this site as a way to share my work with the world. :earth_africa: I'm still a digital humanist in training so this project is outside of my comfort zone, but I've always wondered what static websites are like so I thought I'd try it out after so many years of using WordPress, SquareSpace, and other platforms. It was a bit more difficult to set up than I expected, so I used <b><a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/"> this </a></b> helpful resource to get started. Then I looked at <a href="http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole">this</a> to learn how to modify the standard Minima theme (skipped the Poole steps). :ok_hand: 

In the meantime, I'm really enjoying the simplicity of a static website. It's also been fun to put my HTML/CSS skills to good use again. :dancer:
