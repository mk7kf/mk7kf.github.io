# My Website: Inspirations, Aspirations, and Resources

**http://mk7kf.github.io** is the second iteration of my own GitHub website. This time, instead of relying on a premade template, I coded and designed the entire website by hand for the first time ðŸ™€ -- but I had a lot of help. This ReadMe lists all of the inspirations and resources that I used and/or found useful when building it. 

## Website Inspirations :sparkles:
As you might have noticed, my website straddles the line between academic and non-academic material. For example, the first half of the landing page titled [What I Do . . .](http://mk7kf.github.io) shares my academic pursuits, but the second half titled [. . .And Why I Do It](http://mk7kf.github.io) reveals some autobiographical information, particularly about my grandmother, that has partially shaped the trajectory of my career. It also reflects on the role that settler colonialism and enslaved labor has played in building the institution where I study, live, and work today. Rather than writing a rote land acknowledgement, I wanted to think more carefully about the ways that higher education is deeply entangled with systems of oppression even as it portrays itself as a site for freedom and progressive thought. This short essay is a step toward this endeavor, and it also forms a part of the short essay collection that I am (slowly) working on, titled *A Higher Education*.
* The Praxis Project that I've been working on this year, *Your Name Here*, which is intended to function as a starting point for graduate students in the humanities who want to try creating their own website using HTML/CSS, and are newcomers to the world of coding, design, and the digital humanities. 
* May Helena Plumb's website: https://www.mayhplumb.com/, especially for modelling how solidarity in the academy looks like through sharing grant and fellowship documents, and providing land acknowledgement statements.
* Tao Leigh Goffe's "The Flesh of the Family Album: Black Pacific" (2022), particularly for my " . . . And Why I Do It" section. (I am unable to find an open version of this article.)

## Aspirations or; Edits that I want to make in the future :wrench:
* Ensure that the website conforms to Accessibility principles
* Change the Header image to an animated GIF or video
* Flesh out and improve the Google MyMap of my dissertation 
* Optimize the site for phones as well as desktops
* Create French and Mandarin versions of the website
* Add a "What is Decadence?" page in the Resources tab
* Edit the javascript in the ". . . And Why I Do It" section so that the text begins typing once the user scrolls to the section, not immediately upon loading, and the quote generator in the "Treats" page so that the author names of each quote are bolded and the titles of each text are italicized. I'm a newcomer to Javascript and I couldn't figure out how to do this in time, so if you have any ideas, let me know!

## Web Design Resources :computer:
### About Page
* I created the typing effect in the ". . . And Why I Do it" by adapting some HTML and javascript code in **JC Lee's** "Simple Typing Effect pure JS (beginner)": https://dev.to/ljcdev/simple-typing-effect-pure-js-4p5m. 
* I build the two column layout by adapting some of the code from the "CSS Multiple Columns" lesson at W3 Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_multiple_columns.asp. 
* I found the header image on unsplash.com http://www.unsplash.com, a great site that contains freely-usable high-quality images.
* I found the font on Google Fonts https://fonts.google.com/, which provides freely-usable, high-quality fonts and handy tools for easily importing those fonts into your website. 

### Work Page
* I created the different tabs by adapting the code from the "Collapsibles/Accordian" lesson at W3 Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp
* I created the map of my dissertation by using Google MyMaps: https://mymaps.google.com/. I know that there are several mapping platforms out there but in my experience this is still definitely one of most user-friendly yet also effective platforms for mapping anything you want and customizing the design. 

### Resources Page
* I created the download buttons by adapting the code from the "Download Button" lesson at W3 Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_download_button.asp. 

### Treats Page
* I created the randomized quote generator by adapting the code from **Sophanarith Sok's** "Build a random quote generator with Javascript and HTML for absolute beginners": https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/creating-a-bare-bones-quote-generator-with-javascript-and-html-for-absolute-beginners-5264e1725f08/.
