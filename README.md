# My Website: Inspirations, Aspirations, and Resources

**http://mk7kf.github.io** is the second iteration of my own GitHub website. This time, instead of relying on a premade template, I coded and designed the entire website by hand for the first time ðŸ™€ -- but I had a lot of help. This ReadMe lists all of the inspirations and resources that I used and/or found useful when building it. 

You can also download the HTML, CSS, and Javascript files directly from this repository so that you can see how the website was built -- no shortcuts or other hidden packages / other apps. You can use my site as a template or starting point for your own code if you wish.

## Aspirations or; Edits that I want to make in the future :wrench:
* Ensure that the website conforms to Accessibility principles
* Change the Header image to an animated GIF or video
* Flesh out and improve the Google MyMap of my dissertation 
* Optimize the site for phones as well as desktops
* Add a blog component to the website so that I can write about books that I'm reading
* Create French and Mandarin versions of the website
* Add a "What is Decadence?" page in the Resources tab
* Edit the javascript in the ". . . And Why I Do It" section so that the text begins typing once the user scrolls to the section, not immediately upon loading, and the quote generator in the "Treats" page so that the author names of each quote are bolded and the titles of each text are italicized. I'm a newcomer to Javascript and I couldn't figure out how to do this in time, so if you have any ideas, let me know!

## Web Design Resources :computer:
### About Page
* I created the typing effect in the ". . . And Why I Do it" by adapting some HTML and javascript code in **JC Lee's** "Simple Typing Effect pure JS (beginner)": https://dev.to/ljcdev/simple-typing-effect-pure-js-4p5m. 
* I built the two column layout by adapting some of the code from the "CSS Multiple Columns" lesson at W3 Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_multiple_columns.asp. 
* I found the header image on http://www.unsplash.com, a great site that contains freely-usable high-quality images.
* I found the font on https://fonts.google.com/, which provides freely-usable, high-quality fonts and handy tools for easily importing those fonts into your website. 

### Work Page
* I created the different tabs by adapting the code from the "Collapsibles/Accordian" lesson at W3 Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp
* I created the map of my dissertation by using Google MyMaps: https://mymaps.google.com/. I know that there are several mapping platforms out there but in my experience this is still definitely one of most user-friendly yet also effective platforms for mapping anything you want and customizing the design. 

### Resources Page
* I created the download buttons by adapting the code from the "Download Button" lesson at W3 Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_download_button.asp. 

### Treats Page
* I created the randomized quote generator by adapting the code from **Sophanarith Sok's** "Build a random quote generator with Javascript and HTML for absolute beginners": https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/creating-a-bare-bones-quote-generator-with-javascript-and-html-for-absolute-beginners-5264e1725f08/.
