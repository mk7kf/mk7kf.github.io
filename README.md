# mk7kf.github.io
This is my first GitHub website, built with Jekyll. :computer:  I'm using this site as a way to share my work with the world. :earth_africa: I'm still a digital humanist in training so this project is outside of my comfort zone, but I've always wondered what static websites are like so I thought I'd try it out after so many years of using WordPress, SquareSpace, and other platforms. :blush: It was a little more difficult to set up than I thought it would be, so I used <b><a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/#css"> this </a></b> helpful resource to get started. I would highly recommend it as a starting point for anyone else who is building a GitHub Page for the first time. :ok_hand: In the meantime, I like the simplicity and restraint of a static website. The parameters have prompted me to be more imaginative. :art: It's also been quite fun to put my html/css skills to good use again. :dancer:
