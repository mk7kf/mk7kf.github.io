# My Website

mk7kf.github.io is the second iteration of my own GitHub website. This time, instead of relying on a premade template, I coded and designed the entire website by hand for the first time -- but I had a lot of help. This ReadMe lists all of the inspirations and resources that I used and/or found useful when building it. 

## Website Inspirations
* The Praxis Project that I've been working on this year, *Your Name Here*, which is intended to function as a starting point for graduate students in the humanities who want to try creating their own website using HTML/CSS, and are newcomers to the world of coding, design, and the digital humanities. 
* **May Helena Plumb's** website: https://www.mayhplumb.com/
* **Tao Leigh Goffe's** "The Flesh of the Family Album: Black Pacific" (2022): https://www-degruyter-com.proxy01.its.virginia.edu/document/doi/10.1515/9783110753295-019/html?lang=en, particularly for the " . . . And Why I Do It" section.

## Edits I want to make in the future
* Ensure that the website conforms to Accessibility principles
* Optimize the site for phones as well as desktops
* Create French and Mandarin versions of the website
* Add a "What is Decadence?" page in the Resources tab
* Edit the javascript in the ". . . And Why I Do It" section so that the text begins typing once the user scrolls to the section, not immediately upon loading. I'm a newcomer to javascript so it's my first time working with it -- if you have any ideas, let me know!

## Web Design Resources
### About Page
* I created the typing effect in the ". . . And Why I Do it" by adapting some HTML and javascript code in **JC Lee's** "Simple Typing Effect pure JS (beginner)": https://dev.to/ljcdev/simple-typing-effect-pure-js-4p5m. 
* I build the two column layout by adapting some of the code from the "CSS Multiple Columns" lesson at W3 Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_multiple_columns.asp. 
* I found the header image on unsplash.com http://www.unsplash.com, a great site that contains freely-usable high-quality images.
* I found the font on Google Fonts https://fonts.google.com/, which provides freely-usable, high-quality fonts and handy tools for easily importing those fonts into your website. 

### Work Page
* I created the different tabs by adapting the code from the "Collapsibles/Accordian" lesson at W3 Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp

### Resources Page
* I created the download buttons by adapting the code from the "Download Button" lesson at W3 Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_download_button.asp. 

### Treats Page
* I created the randomized quote generator by adapting the code from **Sophanarith Sok's** "Build a random quote generator with Javascript and HTML for absolute beginners": https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/creating-a-bare-bones-quote-generator-with-javascript-and-html-for-absolute-beginners-5264e1725f08/.
