<p>In no particular order. These texts provoke my continual curiosity, and I hope they do the same for you . . .</p>

  <p><b>Theory</b></p>
      <ul>“Personism: A Manifesto,” Frank O’Hara</ul>
      <blockquote>“But how then can you really care if anybody gets [the poem], or gets what it means, or if it improves them. Improves them for what? For death? Why hurry them along?” </blockquote> 
      <ul>“The Uses of the Erotic,” Audre Lorde</ul>
      <blockquote>  For as we begin to recognize our deepest feelings, we begin to give up, of necessity, being satisfied with suffering and self-negation, and with the numbness which so often seems like the only alternative in our society. </blockquote> 
      <ul>"The Uses of Anger,” Audre Lorde</ul>
      <blockquote>  "Any discussion among women about racism must include the recognition and the use of anger. This discussion must be direct and creative because it is crucial. We cannot allow our fear of anger to deflect us nor seduce us into settling for anything less than the hard work of excavating honesty; we must be quite serious about the choice of this topic and the angers entwined within it because, rest assured, our opponents are quite serious about their hatred of us and of what we are trying to do here.” </blockquote> 
      <ul>“The Muse of History,” Derek Walcott</ul>
      <blockquote>  “They know that by openly fighting a tradition we perpetuate it, that revolutionary literature is a filial impulse, and that maturity is the assimilation of the features of every ancestor.” </blockquote> 
      <ul>“On Forgiveness,” Jacques Derrida</ul>
      <blockquote>  “Forgiveness forgives only the unforgivable.” </blockquote> 
      <ul><i>Virtue Hoarders,</i> Catherine Liu</ul>
      <blockquote>  “The Professional Managerial Class  . .  . is shameless about hoarding all forms of secularised virtue: whenever it addresses a political and economic crisis produced by capitalism itself, the PMC reworks political struggles for policy change and redistribution into individual passion plays, focusing its efforts on individual acts of “giving back” or reified forms of self-transformation.” </blockquote> 
      <ul>“Enchantment,” Rita Felski </ul>
      <ul><i>Our Aesthetic Categories,</i> Sianne Ngai</ul>
      <ul>"The Newly Born Woman," Helen Cixous</ul>
      <ul>“Muteness Envy,” Barbara Johnson</ul>
      <ul> “Ephemera as Evidence,” Jose Esteban Munoz</ul>
      <blockquote>  “Instead of being clearly available as visible evidence, queerness has existed as innuendo, gossip, fleeting moments, and performances that are meant to be interacted with by those within its epistemological sphere—while evaporating at the touch of those who would eliminate queer possibility.” </blockquote> 
      <ul> “The Soul of Man Under Socialism,” Oscar Wilde</ul>
      <ul> “Womanliness as Masquerade,” Joan Rivière</ul>
        <blockquote>  “ . . . she had had dreams of people putting masks on their faces in order to avert disaster” </blockquote> 
      <ul>“The Uncertainty of Signs,” <i>A Lover’s Discourse: Fragments,</i> Roland Barthes.</ul>
      <blockquote>  “I look for signs, but of what? What is the object of my reading? Is it: am I loved (am I loved no longer, am I still loved)? Is it my future that I am trying to read, deciphering in what is inscribed the announcement of what will happen to me, according to a method which combines palaeography and manticism? Isn’t it rather, all things considered, that I remain suspended on this question, whose answer I tirelessly seek in the other’s face: What am I worth?”</blockquote> 
      <ul><i>The Black Atlantic,</i> Paul Gilroy</ul>
    <ul> <i>The Right to Sex,</i> Amia Srinivasan</ul>
    </ul>

  <p><b>Prose</b></p>
  <ul>
    <ul><i>Giovanni’s Room,</i> James Baldwin</ul>
    <blockquote>“I stand at the window of this great house in the south of France as night falls, the night which is leading me to the most terrible morning of my life.</blockquote> 
    <ul><i>"Nothing Personal,"</i> James Baldwin </ul>
  <blockquote>“Pretend, for example, that you were born in Chicago and have never had the remotest desire to visit Hong Kong, which is only a name on a map for you; pretend that some convulsion, sometimes called accident, throws you into connection with a man or a woman who lives in Hong Kong; and that you fall in love. Hong Kong will immediately cease to be a name and become the center of your life. And you may never know how many people live in Hong Kong. But you will know that one man or one woman lives there without whom you cannot live. And this is how our lives are changed, and this is how we are redeemed.” </blockquote> 
    <ul><i>The Age of Innocence,</i> Edith Wharton</ul>
    <ul><i>Desert Of the Heart,</i> Jane Rule</ul>
    <ul><i>How To Be Good,</i> Nick Hornby</ul>
  <blockquote>  “I am in a car park in Leeds when I tell my husband I don’t want to be married to him anymore. David isn’t even in the car park with me. He’s at home, looking after the kids, and I have only called him to remind him that he should write a note for Molly’s class teacher. The other bit just sort of . . . slips out. This is a mistake, obviously.” </blockquote> 
    <ul>“Persons and Places,”<i>Counternarratives,</i> John Keene</ul>
    <blockquote> "This <i>Du Bois</i>, who, I am told by that collector of personalities, William James, fashions himself a philosopher . . . It is true that I have noted him haunting the precincts of the Yard, books peeking from his tattered leather satchel, his cheeks the color of tea into which several tablespoons of sweet cream have been poured, that gaze pressing intently toward some hidden point." </blockquote> 
    <ul>“Why Aren’t You Laughing?” David Sedaris</ul>
    <blockquote> “[My mother] has been dead since 1991, so she missed a lot of the build up to what is now thought of as less than scandalous behavior. I once watched a show in which a group of young men were sent out to collect pubic hair. It was a contest of sorts, and in the end the loser had to put all the spoils on a pizza and eat it. That was in 2003, so, to me, someone on television today shitting on a car— <i>Sure. O.K. That makes sense.</i>” </blockquote> 
    <ul><i>Lucy,</i> Jamaica Kincaid</ul>
    <ul><i>God Of Small Things,</i> Arundhati Roy</ul>
    <ul><i>The Piano Teacher,</i> Janice KY Lee</ul>
    <ul><i>Portrait of a Lady,</i> Henry James</ul>
    <ul>“The Mother,” Lydia Davis</ul>
    <blockquote>  “The girl wrote a story. “But how much better it would be if you wrote a novel,” said her mother. The girl built a dollhouse. “But how much better if it were a real house,” her mother said. The girl made a small pillow for her father. “But wouldn’t a quilt be more practical,” said her mother. The girl dug a small hole in the garden. “But how much better if you dug a large hole,” said her mother. The girl dug a hole and went to sleep in it. “But how much better if you slept forever,” said her mother.”</blockquote> 
    <ul><i>The Bluest Eye,</i> Toni Morrison</ul>
    <ul>“Even If You Beat Me,” Sally Rooney</ul>
    <ul><i>Falling Leaves,</i> Adeline Yen Mah</ul>
    <ul>“Oct. 10-13. Boston Common—More of Emerson,” Walt Whitman</ul>
  <blockquote>  During those two hours he was the talker and I the listener. It was an argument-statement, reconnoitring, review, attack, and pressing home, (like an army corps in order, artillery, cavalry, infantry,) of all that could be said against that part (and a main part) in the construction of my poems, “Children of Adam.” More precious than gold to me that dissertation—it afforded me, ever after, this strange and paradoxical lesson; each point of E.’s statement was unanswerable, no judge’s charge ever more complete or convincing, I could never hear the points better put—and then I felt down in my soul the clear and unmistakable conviction to disobey all, and pursue my own way. </blockquote>
