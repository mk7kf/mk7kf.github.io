<p>I'm a PhD Candidate and an <a href="https://www.jeffersonscholars.org/people/cherrie-kwok">Elizabeth Arendall Tilney and Schuyler Merritt Tilney Jefferson Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/">Univeristy of Virginia.</a> I earned my Bachelor's degree from the University of Exeter (first class honours), and my Master's degree from New York University.</p>
<p>My dissertation examines the relationship between <b>literature</b> and <b>politics</b>. I'm looking at a set of writers from the Black Atlantic, China, and India who constructed anti-imperial ideas by reinventing artistic and social strategies from a late-Victorian movement called <a href="https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/aestheticism-and-decadence">Decadence</a>. I expect to present an abridged version of my first chapter at the 2022 MLA Convention.
<p>My work builds on my primary research interests in global Anglophone literature (especially in the long nineteenth century), Digital Humanities, Poetry, and Postcolonialism. Two of my research articles are currently under review (one examining Decadent Symbolist poetics, and the other examining subaltern muteness in the Victorian novel). I also have an interest in Writing and Composition Studies, particularly in the areas of digital media and digital writing, and have published about some of my teaching in <a href="https://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/using-wikipedia-in-the-composition-classroom-and-beyond-encyclopedic-neutrality-social-inequality-and-failure-as-subversion/"><i>The Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy</i></a>. Whenever I get a spare moment, I also like to <a href="https://chajournal.blog/2021/04/27/hong-kong-aftershock/">review books</a> about my hometown, Hong Kong. 
<p>Elsewhere, I am a Lead Developer for the Undisciplining the Victorian Classroom project, where I have built a peer-reviewed teaching pathway about <a href="https://undiscipliningvc.org/html/lesson_plans/africa_dramatic_monologue.html"> the role of race and imperialism in the dramatic monologue</a>. I also co-direct the<a href="https://jeffersontrust.org/2021/04/jefferson-trust-awards-109800-in-flash-grants/"> Teaching Writing and Anti-Racism in the ENWR 1510 Classroom project</a>, and work as a Researcher for UVA & the Southern Poverty Law Center's <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/uva-professors-and-local-teachers-take-teaching-hard-literature-project">Teaching Hard Literature project </a>. I have also co-chaired my department's graduate conference, and presented papers at the Victorians Institute annual conference, the CUNY Graduate Conference, the British Conference of Undergraduate Research, and The Undergraduate Awards. 
<p>Complementing my work in academia, I have volunteered as a Reader and Respondent for <a href="https://thewomensinitiative.org/">The Women's Intitiative's</a> Challenge into Change Writing Competition, organized two Wikipedia Edit-A-Thons, and have continued to contribute my time to the Programs arm of the <a href="https://www.amadoudiallo.org/"> Amadou Diallo Foundation</a>.</p>
