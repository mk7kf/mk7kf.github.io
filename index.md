<p>I'm a PhD Candidate and an <a href="https://www.jeffersonscholars.org/people/cherrie-kwok">Elizabeth Arendall Tilney and Schuyler Merritt Tilney Jefferson Fellow</a> in the Department of English at the <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/">Univeristy of Virginia.</a></p>
<p>My dissertation focuses on the relationship between <b>literature</b> :book: and <b>politics</b> :classical_building:. I'm examining a set of writers from Black America, the Caribbean, China, and India who constructed anti-imperial ideas by reinventing artistic and social strategies from a late-Victorian movement called <a href="https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/aestheticism-and-decadence">Decadence</a>. This study is being completed under the guidance of Stephen Arata (Chair), Rita Felski, Njelle Hamilton, and Jerome McGann. 
<p>My work builds on my existing research interests in Global Anglophone Literature (especially from the Victorian period onwards), Digital Humanities, Poetry (from classical to contemporary), and Postcolonial Theory. I am also interested in composition studies, particularly in the areas of digital media, digital writing, and social media. :nerd_face:</p>
