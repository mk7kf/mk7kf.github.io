<p>I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of English at the University of Virginia, where I hold the Elizabeth Arendall Tilney and Schuyler Merritt Tilney Jefferson Fellowship. I focus on the literature, culture, and history of the global nineteenth century, with interests in Decadence, Empire, and critical theory.</p>

<p>My dissertation examines the relationship between Decadence and anti-imperialism through a set of writers from the African, Asian, and Indigenous diasporas in the late nineteenth century and beyond. In the process, my work aims to undiscipline the theoretical and aesthetic foundations of Decadence studies by bringing perspectives in Asian and Asian American studies, Black studies, Indigenous studies, Latinx Studies, and queer/quare theory to bear on our understanding of Decadence, as well as elucidating how the work in Decadence studies might in turn support the development of those fields. Outside of my dissertation, I'm also interested in the ways that Decadence resurfaces in, and shapes, our world today.</p>

<p>My first piece of literary criticism, “Symbolism, Empire, and the Dance: on Sarojini Naidu’s ‘Eastern Dancers’ and Arthur Symons’ ‘Javanese Dancers,’” was published in <i>Volupté: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Decadence Studies</i>, and received the 2021 British Association for Decadence Studies Postgraduate Essay Prize. I have also published peer-reviewed work related to pedagogy and teaching. My public-facing work has largely focused on reviewing books about postcolonial Hong Kong, my hometown. You can find out more about my work here.</p> 

<p>I also have interests in the digital humanities. I’m a Praxis Fellowship at the UVa Library Scholars’ Lab, where I’m working with a group of graduate students to develop a digital project about coding. I like to engage with web design, text analysis, manuscript transcription, and TEI encoding, and have taught classes related to digital writing and social media.</p> 

<p>I received my M.A. in English and American Literature at New York University, where my work was awarded the department’s Millicent Bell Prize, and my B.A. in English with Classical Studies and Theology (first-class) from the University of Exeter.</p>
