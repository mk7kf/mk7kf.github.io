<sup><i>Hong Kong, circa 1995</i></sup>
<p>I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of English at the University of Virginia, where I hold the Elizabeth Arendall Tilney and Schuyler Merritt Tilney Jefferson Fellowship. I focus on the literature, culture, and history of the global nineteenth century, with interests in Decadence, Empire, and critical theory. I'm also interested in how the nineteenth century continues to shape our world today. My first piece of pbulished literary criticism, “Symbolism, Empire, and the Dance: On Sarojini Naidu’s ‘Eastern Dancers’ and Arthur Symons’ ‘Javanese Dancers'” received the 2021 British Association for Decadence Studies Postgraduate Essay Prize. You can find out more about my work here.</p>

<p>I also have interests in the digital humanities. I’m a Praxis Fellowship at the UVa Library Scholars’ Lab, where I’m working with a group of graduate students to develop a digital project about coding. I like to engage with web design, text analysis, manuscript transcription, and TEI encoding, and have taught classes related to digital writing and social media. Before starting my doctorate, I worked full-time for the NYU Center for Data Science, where I translated our faculty's peer-reviewed research about natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and computational biology, into layperson's terms for communications team and the wider public. </p> 

<p>I received my M.A. in English and American Literature at New York University, where my work was awarded the department’s Millicent Bell Prize, and my B.A. in English with Classical Studies and Theology (first-class) from the University of Exeter.</p>
