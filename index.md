<p>Hi there.  I'm a third-year PhD Candidate and the Elizabeth Arendall Tilney Jefferson Fellow in the Department of English at the Univeristy of Virginia. My dissertation examines the relationship between <b>literature</b> :book: and <b>politics</b> :classical_building:.  More specifically, I'm studying how writers from Black America, the Caribbean, China, and India constructed anti-imperial ideas in their poetry and prose using a late-Victorian aesthetic and social movement called <b>Decadence</b>.  This work builds on my existing research interests in Global Anglophone Literature (especially from the Victorian period onwards), Digital Humanities, Poetry, and Critical Theory with a particular focus on race and postcolonialism.
  
<p>This is my first GitHub website, built with Jekyll. I'm using this site as a way to share my work. Using GitHub has been a bit outside of my comfort zone, but I've always wondered what static websites are like so I thought I'd try it out. Feel free to take a look around to learn more about me.  :woman_technologist: </p>
