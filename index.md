<p>I'm a PhD Candidate and an <a href="https://www.jeffersonscholars.org/people/cherrie-kwok">Elizabeth Arendall Tilney and Schuyler Merritt Tilney Jefferson Fellow</a> in the Department of English at the <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/">Univeristy of Virginia.</a></p>
<p>My dissertation focuses on the relationship between :book: <b>literature</b> :book: and :classical_building: <b>politics</b> :classical_building:. I'm studying how a set of writers from Black America, the Caribbean, China, and India constructed anti-imperial ideas by reinventing artistic and social strategies from a late-Victorian movement called <a href="https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/aestheticism-and-decadence">Decadence</a>. 
<p>My work builds on my existing research interests in Global Anglophone Literature (especially from the Victorian period onwards), Digital Humanities, Poetry (from classical to contemporary), and Postcolonial Theory.</p>
