<p>I'm a PhD Candidate and an <a href="https://www.jeffersonscholars.org/people/cherrie-kwok">Elizabeth Arendall Tilney and Schuyler Merritt Tilney Jefferson Fellow</a> in the Department of English at the <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/">Univeristy of Virginia.</a></p>
<p>My dissertation focuses on the relationship between :book: literature and :classical_building: politics. More specifically, I'm studying how writers from Black America, the Caribbean, China, and India constructed anti-imperial ideas in their poetry and prose by drawing on a late-Victorian aesthetic and social movement called <a href="https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/aestheticism-and-decadence">Decadence</a>. My work builds on my existing research interests in Global Anglophone Literature (especially from the Victorian period onwards), Digital Humanities, Poetry, and Postcolonial Theory.</p>
  
<p>This is my first GitHub website, built with Jekyll. I'm using this site to share my work. Feel free to take a look around to learn more about me.  :woman_technologist: </p>
