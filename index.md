<p>I'm a PhD Candidate and the Elizabeth Arendall Tilney Jefferson Fellow in the Department of English at the Univeristy of Virginia. My dissertation examines the relationship between literature :book: and politics :classical_building:.  More specifically, I'm studying how writers from Black America, the Caribbean, China, and India constructed anti-imperial ideas in their poetry and prose by drawing on a late-Victorian aesthetic and social movement called Decadence. My work builds on my existing research interests in Global Anglophone Literature (especially from the Victorian period onwards), Digital Humanities, Poetry, and Postcolonial Theory.
  
<p>This is my first GitHub website, built with Jekyll. I'm using this site to share my work. Feel free to take a look around to learn more about me.  :woman_technologist: </p>
