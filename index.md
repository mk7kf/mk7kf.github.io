<p>I'm a PhD Candidate and an <a href="https://www.jeffersonscholars.org/people/cherrie-kwok">Elizabeth Arendall Tilney and Schuyler Merritt Tilney Jefferson Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/">Univeristy of Virginia.</a> Previously, I earned my Bacehlor's degree from the University of Exeter (first class honours), and my Master's degree from New York University.</p>
<p>My dissertation focuses on the relationship between <b>literature</b> :book: and <b>politics</b> :classical_building:. I'm examining a set of writers from the Black Atlantic, the Caribbean, China, and India who constructed anti-imperial ideas by reinventing artistic and social strategies from a late-Victorian movement called <a href="https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/aestheticism-and-decadence">Decadence</a>. This study is being completed under the guidance of Stephen Arata (Chair), Rita Felski, Njelle Hamilton, and Jerome McGann. 
<p>My work builds on my primary research interests in Global Anglophone Literature (especially from the Victorian period onwards), Digital Humanities, Poetry (from classical to contemporary), and Postcolonialism. I also have an interest in Writing and Composition Studies, particularly in the areas of digital media and digital writing. I have published about some of my work in these areas <a href="https://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/using-wikipedia-in-the-composition-classroom-and-beyond-encyclopedic-neutrality-social-inequality-and-failure-as-subversion/">here</a>, and am also currently preparing a research article about Decadent poetics.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I have presented papers at the Victorians Institute (2019), the CUNY Graduate Conference (2017), the British Conference of Undergraduate Research (2015), and The Undergraduate Awards (2014). I am also a Lead Developer for<a href="https://undiscipliningvc.org/index.html"> Undisciplining the Victorian Classroom </a>, where I am building a pathway about the racial inflections of the dramatic monologue; a Co-Director for the Teaching Writing and Anti-Racism in the ENWR 1510 Classroom project at UVA; a Researcher for the <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/uva-professors-and-local-teachers-take-teaching-hard-literature-project">Teaching Hard Literature project </a> at UVA's Center for Liberal Arts & the Southern Poverty Law Center; and have Co-Chaired my department's Graduate Conference (2020).  
<p>Complementing my work in academia, I have volunteered as a Reader and Respondent for <a href="https://thewomensinitiative.org/">The Women's Intitiative's</a> Challenge into Change Writing Competition (2020), organized two Wikipedia Edit-A-Thons (2019, 2020) focused on recovering Black literature and student activism histories, and have continued to contribute my time to the Programs arm of the <a href="https://www.amadoudiallo.org/"> Amadou Diallo Foundation</a>.</p>
