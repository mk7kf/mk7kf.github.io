  '"No matter what else people may steal from you, they will never be able to take away your knowledge." -- Adeline Yen Mah, Falling Leaves (1997)',
  '"And here it is that feminism discovered itself to be Impossible. The simple fact was that most feminists liked male style, at least sometimes, and this liking was able to withstand the most ardent ministrations of theory. The true threat of the bar butch, after all, was not that she was apolitical; it was that she was hot."" -- Andrea Long Chu, The Impossibility of Feminism',
  '"But what was there to say? Only that there were tears. Only that Quietness and Emptiness fitted together like stacked spoons. Only that there was a snuffling in the hollows at the base of a lovely throat. Only that a hard honey-colored shoulder had a semicircle of teethmarks on it. Only that they held each other close, long after it was over. Only that what they shared that night was not happiness, but hideous grief." -- Arundhati Roy, The God of Small Things (1997)',
  '"For as we begin to recognize our deepest feelings, we begin to give up, of necessity, being satisfied with suffering and self-negation, and with the numbness which so often seems like the only alternative in our society." -- Audre Lorde, The Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power (1978)',
  '"Any discussion among women about racism must include the recognition and the use of anger. This discussion must be direct and creative because it is crucial. We cannot allow our fear of anger to deflect us nor seduce us into settling for anything less than the hard work of excavating honesty; we must be quite serious about the choice of this topic and the angers entwined within it because, rest assured, our opponents are quite serious about their hatred of us and of what we are trying to do here." -- Audre Lorde, The Uses of Anger (1978)',
  '"Far from being the opposite of authority, victimhood would seem to be the most effective model for authority, particularly literary and cultural authority. It is not that the victim always gets to speak— far from it— but that the most highly valued speaker gets to claim victimhood." -- Barbara Johnson, Muteness Envy (1989)',
  ' ". . .and I wonder what kind of pain he has been / through to not want me in this world with him anymore. and i wince a little because the earth has not held all of me for quite some time now" -- Billy-Ray Belcourt, sacred (2016)',
  '"The Professional Managerial Class  . .  . is shameless about hoarding all forms of secularised virtue: whenever it addresses a political and economic crisis produced by capitalism itself, the PMC reworks political struggles for policy change and redistribution into individual passion plays, focusing its efforts on individual acts of “giving back” or reified forms of self-transformation." -- Catherine Liu, Virtue Hoarders: The Case Against the Professional Managerial Class (2021)',
  '"[My mother] has been dead since 1991, so she missed a lot of the build up to what is now thought of as less than scandalous behavior. I once watched a show in which a group of young men were sent out to collect pubic hair. It was a contest of sorts, and in the end the loser had to put all the spoils on a pizza and eat it. That was in 2003, so, to me, someone on television today shitting on a car: Sure. O.K. That makes sense." -- David Sedaris, Why Aren\'t You Laughing? (2017)',
  '"They know that by openly fighting a tradition we perpetuate it, that revolutionary literature is a filial impulse, and that maturity is the assimilation of the features of every ancestor."" -- Derek Walcott, The Muse of History (1974)',
  '"And then it came over him, in a vast flash made up of many broken gleams, that to all of them he and Madame Olenska were lovers, lovers in the extreme sense peculiar to "foreign" vocabularies. He guessed himself to have been, for months, the centre of countless silently observing eyes and patiently listening ears; he understood that, by means as yet unknown to him, the separation between himself and the partner of his guilt had been achieved, and that now the whole tribe had rallied about his wife on the tacit assumption that nobody knew anything, or had ever imagined anything . . . It was the old New York way of taking life without effusion of blood: the way of people who dreaded scandal more than disease, who placed decency above courage, and who considered that nothing was more ill–bred than scenes, except the behaviour of those who gave rise to them." -- Edith Wharton, The Age of Innocence (1920)',
  '"But how then can you really care if anybody gets it [the poem], or gets what it means, or if it improves them. Improves them for what? For death? Why hurry them along?" -- Frank O\'Hara, Personism: A Manifesto',
  '"One of the things, for example, that I encounter paradoxically all the time is public talk from women I respect about women grabbing power. And then when I use what little power I have been able to grab in public to cope with masculine intervention, then among the women I quite often receive a reputation for arrogance. You see, so that to an extent this had led to great intellectual insecurity. Yes, I was quite prepared to believe that I was not good enough for the best institutions. And , to an extent, I still feel that way, that I do not have the right to intervene. In fact, we\'ve come from a session where I very much wanted to intervene, but I kept myself quiet because I thought no one wants to hear me, or they\'d think I\'m arrogant. See what I mean?" -- Gayatri Spivak, Interview with Leon de Kock',
  '"She alone dares and wants to know from within where she, the one excluded, has never ceased to hear what-comes-before-language reverberating. She lets the other tongue of a thousand tongues speak -- the tongue, sound without barrier or death. She refuses life nothing. Her tongue doesn\'t hold back but holds forth, doesn\'t keep in but keeps on enabling. Where the wonder of being several and turmoil is expressed, she does not protect herself against these unknown feminines; she surprises herself at seeing, being, pleasuring in her gift of changeability." -- Hélène Cixous, The Newly Born Woman',
  '"Forgiveness forgives only the unforgivable / Le pardon, s\'il y en a, ne doit et ne peut pardonner que l\'impardonnable, l\'inexpiable--et donc faire impossible." -- Jacques Derrida, On Forgiveness / Sur le pardon',
  '"Pretend, for example, that you were born in Chicago and have never had the remotest desire to visit Hong Kong, which is only a name on a map for you; pretend that some convulsion, sometimes called accident, throws you into connection with a man or a woman who lives in Hong Kong; and that you fall in love. Hong Kong will immediately cease to be a name and become the center of your life. And you may never know how many people live in Hong Kong. But you will know that one man or one woman lives there without whom you cannot live. And this is how our lives are changed, and this is how we are redeemed." -- James Baldwin, Nothing Personal',
  '"The exhibition in public of her intellectual proficiency, which was in itself carried through successfully, signified an exhibition of herself in possession of the father\'s penis, having castrated him. The display once over, she was seized by horrible dread of the retribution the father would then exact. Obviously it was a step towards propitiating the avenger to endeavor to offer herself to him sexually.  . . . The aim of the compulsion was not merely to secure reassurance by evoking friendly feelings towards her in the man; it was chiefly to make sure of safety by masquerading as guiltless and innocent. It was a compulsive reversal of her intellectual performance; and the two together formed the “double-action” of an obsessive act . . . Womanliness therefore could be assumed and worn as a mask, both to hide the possession of masculinity and to avert the reprisals expected if she was found to possess it — much as a thief will turn out his pockets and ask to be searched to prove that he has not the stolen goods. The reader may now ask how I define womanliness or where I draw the line between genuine womanliness and the \'masquerade\'. My suggestion is not, however, that there is any such difference; whether radical or superficial. They are the same thing." -- Joan Rivière, Womanliness as Masquerade',
  '"This "Du Bois", who, I am told by that collector of personalities, William James, fancies himself a philosopher . . .It is true that I have noted him haunting the precincts of the Yard, books peeking from his tattered leather satchel, his cheeks the color of tea into which several tablespoons of sweet cream have been poured, that gaze pressing intently toward some hidden point." -- John Keene, Persons and Places',
  '"Instead of being clearly available as visible evidence, queerness has existed as innuendo, gossip, fleeting moments, and performances that are meant to be interacted with by those within its epistemological sphere—while evaporating at the touch of those who would eliminate queer possibility." -- Jose Esteban Muñoz, Ephemera As Evidence: Introductory Notes to Queer Acts',
  '"The calm, / Cool face of the river / Asked me for a kiss." -- Langston Hughes, Suicide\'s Note',
  '"I\'d been waiting so long / to hear God speak--I hadn\'t thought to think / of what he might tell me" -- Leila Chatti, Mary',
  '"Wat a devilment a Englan! / Dem face war an brave de worse, / But me wonderin how dem gwine stan / Colonizin in reverse." -- Louise Bennett Coverley, Colonization in Reverse',
  '"in my own defense / what could I choose but to slide along behind them, /they whose only sin / was being their father’s children?" -- Lucille Clifton, brothers',
  '"The girl wrote a story. “But how much better it would be if you wrote a novel,” said her mother. The girl built a dollhouse. “But how much better if it were a real house,” her mother said. The girl made a small pillow for her father. “But wouldn’t a quilt be more practical,” said her mother. The girl dug a small hole in the garden. “But how much better if you dug a large hole,” said her mother. The girl dug a hole and went to sleep in it. “But how much better if you slept forever,” said her mother." -- Lydia Davis, The Mother ',
  '"My lover comes to me like darkfall—long, / and through my open window. Mullion, transom. / A good window lets the outside participate." -- Natalie Diaz, Like Church',
  '"I am in a car park in Leeds when I tell my husband I don’t want to be married to him anymore. David isn’t even in the car park with me. He’s at home, looking after the kids, and I have only called him to remind him that he should write a note for Molly’s class teacher. The other bit just sort of . . . slips out. This is a mistake, obviously." -- Nick Hornby, How To Be Good',
  '"Dearest Father, forgive me for I have seen." -- Ocean Vuong, Prayer for the Newly Damned',
  '"For what is Nature?  Nature is no great mother who has borne us.  She is our creation.  It is in our brain that she quickens to life.  Things are because we see them, and what we see, and how we see it, depends on the Arts that have influenced us.  To look at a thing is very different from seeing a thing.  One does not see anything until one sees its beauty.  Then, and then only, does it come into existence.  At present, people see fogs, not because there are fogs, but because poets and painters have taught them the mysterious loveliness of such effects.  There may have been fogs for centuries in London.  I dare say there were.  But no one saw them, and so we do not know anything about them.  They did not exist till Art had invented them." -- Oscar Wilde, The Critic As Artist',
  '"What, finally, should we make of enchantment\'s association with passivity, submission, and surrender? The condition of being totally absorbed by a book or a film is often expressed through images of being captured, caught up, held hostage. To speak of being overwhelmed to a text is to admit to a fervency and helplessness of response at odds with our usual sense of the knowing, self-possessed critic . . . This sense of something "swoonier, more embarrassing" is, as we have seen, often disacowed or directed onto the figure of the gullible or naive reader. Yet it forms part of a long and diverse history of aesthetic, erotic, and religious practices that evidence a longing to loosen the fetters of consciousness, to experience the voluptuous and sometimes vertiginous pleasures of self-loss." -- Rita Felski, Enchantment',
  '"I look for signs, but of what? What is the object of my reading? Is it: am I loved (am I loved no longer, am I still loved)? Is it my future that I am trying to read, deciphering in what is inscribed the announcement of what will happen to me, according to a method which combines palaeography and manticism? Isn\’t it rather, all things considered, that I remain suspended on this question, whose answer I tirelessly seek in the other’s face: What am I worth? / Je cherche des signes, mais de quoi? Quel est l\'objet de ma lecture ? Est-ce : suis-je aimé (ne le suis-je plus, le suis-je encore)? Est-ce mon avenir que j\'essaye de lire, déchiffrant dans ce qui est inscrit l\'annonce de ce qui va m\'arriver, selon un procédé qui tiendrait à la fois de la paléographie et de la mantique ? N\'est-ce pas plutôt, tout compte fait, que je reste suspendu à cette question, dont je demande au visage de l\'autre, inlassablement, la réponse : qu\'est-ce que je vaux?" -- Roland Barthes, The Uncertainty of Signs',
  '"Indeed, in spite of the prominent example of the Kantian sublime, there has been surprisingly little attention to how a class of judgements underwritten by mixed or even contradictory feelings might put interesting new pressures on the theory of aesthetic judgment in general, including the longstanding assumption that aesthetic judgments must always be based on a single and unequivocal feeling: "disinterestedness" or "conviction." Surely there are other feelings and/or combinations of feelings on which the appraisals of value or quality we feel compelled to share with others in public might be based?" -- Sianne Ngai, Our Aesthetic Categories',
  '"Their conversation is like a gently wicked dance: sound meets sound, curtsies, shimmies, and retires. Another sound enters but is upstaged by still another: the two circle each other and stop. Sometimes their words move in lofty spirals; other times they take strident leaps, and all of it is punctuated with warm-pulsed laughter—like the throb of a heart made of jelly. The edge, the curl, the thrust of their emotions is always clear to Frieda and me. We do not, cannot, know the meanings of all their words, for we are nine and ten years old. So we watch their faces, their hands, their feet, and listen for truth in timbre." -- Toni Morrison, The Bluest Eye',
  '"During those two hours he was the talker and I the listener. It was an argument-statement, reconnoitring, review, attack, and pressing home, (like an army corps in order, artillery, cavalry, infantry,) of all that could be said against that part (and a main part) in the construction of my poems, “Children of Adam.” More precious than gold to me that dissertation—it afforded me, ever after, this strange and paradoxical lesson; each point of E.’s statement was unanswerable, no judge’s charge ever more complete or convincing, I could never hear the points better put—and then I felt down in my soul the clear and unmistakable conviction to disobey all, and pursue my own way." -- Walt Whitman (diary entry about meeting Ralph Waldo Emerson)',
  '"Chaucer Tales were an unfinished business. / May the best poet lose, as the saying goes./ May the best poet muse be mainstaying those / on the stage, on the page, on their subject: /me and April, we\'re The Rhyming Couplet." -- Patience Agbabi, Telling Tales',
  '"I have scars on my hand from touching certain people. Once, in the park, when Frannie was still in the carriage, I put my hand on the downy pate of her head and left it there too long. Another time, at Seventy-second Street, with Zooey during a spooky movie. He was about six or seven, and he went under the seat to avoid watching a scary scene. I put my hand on his head. Certain heads, certain colors and textures of human hair leave permanent marks on me. Other things, too. Charlotte once ran away from me, outside the studio, and I grabbed her dress to stop her, to keep her near me. A yellow cotton dress I loved because it was too long for her. I still have a lemon-yellow mark on the palm of my right hand." -- J.D. Salinger, Raise High the Roofbeam, Carpenters',
  '"O! learn to read what silent love hath writ: / To hear with eyes belongs to love\'s fine wit." --  William Shakespeare',
  '"Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises / Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not. / Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices / That, if I then had waked after long sleep / Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming / The clouds methought would open and show riches /Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked, / I cried to dream again." -- William Shakespeare',
  '"Is fiction which makes fact alive, fact too?" -- Robert Browning',
  '"For our one chance lies in expanding that interval, in getting as many pulsations as possible into the given time. Great passions may give us this quickened sense of life, ecstasy and sorrow of love, the various forms of enthusiastic activity, disinterested or otherwise, which come naturally to many of us. Only be sure it is passion—that it does yield you this fruit of a quickened, multiplied consciousness. Of this wisdom, the poetic passion, the desire of beauty, the love of art for art\'s sake, has most; for art comes to you professing frankly to give nothing but the highest quality to your moments as they pass, and simply for those moments\' sake." -- Walter Pater',
  '"Talent is insignificant. I know a lot of talented ruins. Beyond talent lie all the usual words: discipline, love, luck, but, most of all, endurance. -- James Baldwin, Interview with Jordan Elgrably (1984)"',
  '"It is never entirely true that you don\’t give a shit what others say about you, but you must throw it out of your mind.  It could make one\’s head spin, the number of labels that have been attached to me." -- James Baldwin, Interview with Jordan Elgrably (1984)',
  '"I don\’t try to be prophetic, as I don\’t sit down to write literature. It is simply this: a writer has to take all the risks of putting down what he sees. No one can tell him about that. No one can control that reality. It reminds me of something Pablo Picasso was supposed to have said to Gertrude Stein while he was painting her portrait. Gertrude said, “I don’t look like that.” And Picasso replied, “You will.” And he was right." -- James Baldwin,Interview with Jordan Elgrably (1984)'
