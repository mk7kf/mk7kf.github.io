        <div class="panel">
          <p>Titled <i>Début de Siècle: Duvalian Decadence, Anti-Imperialism, and the Decadent Futures of Our Victorian Profession,</i> my dissertation examines how a set of African American, Asian, Caribbean, and Indigenous writers used Decadent styles and themes in order to articulate anti-imperial perspectives in their poetry and prose from the late nineteenth century and beyond. In the process, my work aims to reshape the theoretical, historical, and aesthetic foundations of Decadence studies. A simple map that visualizes the geographical and temporal intersections between some of the writers in my dissertation can be found <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1GlvOuqYK1-YMbvxfFrX4llXmyUwluipq&ll=44.147574744647365%2C-32.217178897562576&z=2" target= "_blank">here.</a> Due to time and resource contraints, at present the map only covers the period between 1800-1890. The dissertation itself, however, extends beyond the 1890s into the early 1900s.</p>

              <h3>Postcolonial Ephemera: Collecting Fragments of Decadent Hong Kong</h3>
                <p>I am collecting zines and other ephemeral material about Hong Kong. The initial iteration of the collection, which contains 15 items, received the runner-up prize at the 2022 UVa Bibliographic Society's Biennal Book Collecting Contest.</p>
              <h3><i>A Higher Education</i></h3>
                <p>I'm (very) slowly working on a small collection of short essays, provisionally titled <i>A Higher Education</i>. Inspired by W.E.B. Du Bois's "Education in the Last Decades of the Nineteenth Century" in <i>Dusk of Dawn</i> (1940), these essays reflect on interesting encounters I have had in British and North American academia, my childhood in Hong Kong and Vancouver, and my shifting relationship to Europe. These essays are intended for a general audience. A brief, abridged preview of some of this work is available in the <a href=" https://mk7kf.github.io/#and_why_i_do_it"> "And Why I Do It" section on the About page of this website.</a></p>
