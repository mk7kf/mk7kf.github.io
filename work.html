          <p>Titled <i>Début de Siècle: Duvalian Decadence, Anti-Imperialism, and the Decadent Futures of Our Victorian Profession,</i> my dissertation examines the relationship between Decadent literature and anti-imperialism, and also offers a renewed history about Decadence that takes race and postcolonial theory into account. I begin by disrupting Charles Baudelaire’s place as the exclusive origin of Decadent aesthetics. I expose instead how this origin is multiracial since the tropes he produced—such as degeneration, excess, and sensuality—were partial responses to his long affair with a Haitian dancer, Jeanne Duval, who moved to Paris after the 1804 Haitian Revolution. Drawing on 150 historical fragments about her, I offer a new approach for detecting Decadent aesthetics called “Duvalian Decadence.” I argue that this approach illuminates how a set of African-American, Caribbean, East Asian, South Asian, and Indigenous writers of color after Duval produced new forms of Decadence in order to articulate anti-imperial perspectives in their writing. In the process, I expose how Decadence—commonly thought of as an imperialist aesthetic—can support anti-imperial politics. </p>
