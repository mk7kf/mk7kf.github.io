    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>My first book project, <i> Duvalian Decadence</i>, is based on my doctoral dissertation, "After Haiti: Race, Empire, and Global Decadent Literary Resistance, 1804-1984." Placing the Global North in a comparative and multilingual conversation with the Global South, this book project offers a fresh evaluation of a multifaceted artistic and literary style named decadence in the long nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. First, it elucidates a new history about the birth of decadence that starts with the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804)—the world's first and only successful slave-led rebellion—and the subsequent colonization of Hong Kong in 1842, and the impact of these seismic events on the canonical decadent writers of the American, British, and French Empires. Second, it examines how enslaved and colonized writers and their descendents, from Mohawk Canada to Hyderabad, India, created their own versions of artistic and literary decadence in order to cultivate forms of self-regard and decolonial thought within and against the era's racial and imperial oppressions. The project coins the term "Duvalian decadence" to describe their literatures, after nineteenth-century French decadent poet Charles Baudelaire's oft-disregarded Haitian mistress, Jeanne Duval. A digital archive about some of the writers in the book project is also in-progress.</p>
