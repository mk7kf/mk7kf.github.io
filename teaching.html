    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    <p>In all my courses, I invite my students to see themselves firstly as individuals within a larger historical narrative. A twenty-first century education requires students to understand the significance of what they have inherited; my expertise as a teacher, then, is encouraging students to explore how the world that they see and expeience today was shaped, in part, by the histories of settler colonialism, imperialism, and white supremacy, and how these histories account for many of our present-day struggles. Secondly, though, I also invite my students to see themselves as meaningful actors who have the power to shape the future that they want to see, particularly through the power of the written word in the digital age. Drawing on my background in the digital humanities and my former role as a full-time Content and Social Media Manager before starting my doctorate, I encourage students to engage with course themes through digital mediums and platforms such as Instagram, Twitter/X, and Wikipedia.</p>

    <p>Outside of my affiliations to various higher education institutions, I also serve as an Associate Editor for <i><a href="https://undiscipliningvc.org/">Undisciplining the Victorian Classroom</a></i>, a peer-reviewed publication focused on producing race-conscious curricular materials and lesson plans about the nineteenth century.</p>

    <p>An abbreviated list of courses that I have taught (or will teach) as well as various pedagogy-related publications, working groups, and awards are below. A full CV is available upon request.</p>
